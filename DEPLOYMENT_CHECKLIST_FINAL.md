- [ ] Initialize git: `git init`
- [ ] Configure git: `git config user.name "Your Name"` and `git config user.email "your@email.com"`
- [ ] Check files to commit: `git status` (should see app.R, .xlsx, .gitignore, .md files)
- [ ] Add files: `git add .`
- [ ] Make initial commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit: Secure R Shiny dashboard with rate limiting"`

### **GitHub Repository**
- [ ] Go to GitHub.com and create new repository
- [ ] Repository name: `where-should-you-live-dashboard`
- [ ] Make it **PUBLIC** (it's now secure!)
- [ ] Don't initialize with README (you have one)
- [ ] Copy the repository URL

### **Push to GitHub**
- [ ] Connect to GitHub: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/where-should-you-live-dashboard.git`
- [ ] Push code: `git push -u origin main`
- [ ] ✅ Verify code appears on GitHub
- [ ] ✅ Check that .gitignore worked (no API keys visible)
- [ ] ✅ README.md displays nicely on GitHub

## 🌐 **PHASE 3: SHINYAPPS.IO DEPLOYMENT**

### **Account Setup**
- [ ] Create account at shinyapps.io (free tier is fine)
- [ ] Go to Account → Tokens
- [ ] Copy your name, token, and secret

### **Configure R Connection**
- [ ] Install rsconnect: `install.packages("rsconnect")`
- [ ] Configure account:
```r
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
  name = "your-username",
  token = "your-token",
  secret = "your-secret"
)
```
- [ ] Verify connection: `rsconnect::accounts()`

### **Deploy Application**
- [ ] Ensure you're in project directory: `getwd()`
- [ ] Deploy app:
```r
rsconnect::deployApp(
  appDir = ".",
  appName = "where-should-you-live",
  appTitle = "Where Should You Live? - City Recommendation Dashboard"
)
```
- [ ] ✅ Deployment completes successfully (watch for URL in console)
- [ ] ✅ App opens in browser automatically

## 🧪 **PHASE 4: LIVE TESTING**

### **Public App Verification**
- [ ] ✅ Live app loads at public URL
- [ ] ✅ All tabs function correctly
- [ ] ✅ Maps render properly

- [ ] ✅ AI chat shows demo responses

### **Rate Limiting on Live App**
- [ ] Test weather API rapid requests
- [ ] ✅ Rate limit notification appears after ~20 requests
- [ ] Test AI chat rapid requests  
- [ ] ✅ Rate limit warning appears after 5 requests
- [ ] ✅ App gracefully handles rate limits

### **Mobile & Browser Testing**
- [ ] ✅ Test on mobile device (responsive design)
- [ ] ✅ Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] ✅ No JavaScript errors in browser console (F12)
